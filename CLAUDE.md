# Claude Code Instructions

## Documentation Research
- Use `docs.rs` directly for Rust library documentation instead of trying to explore the codebase or use agents
- Go to https://docs.rs/[crate]/[version] for quick, accurate API reference

## Code Quality
- Always run `cargo check` to verify compilation before ending work on Rust code
- Do not consider a task complete without running `cargo check` successfully
